# 🎮 SuperVictor Game Update - October 2025

Hey SuperVictor Community! 👋

We're excited to share some important improvements to the game that make it smoother, more accurate, and more fun to play. Here's what's new:

---

## 🚀 What's New

### 1. **Consistent Game Speed Across All Devices** ⚡
**The Problem:** Players with high refresh rate monitors (144Hz, 240Hz) experienced the game running 2-4x faster than intended, making it nearly impossible to play.

**The Fix:** We've completely overhauled the game's physics engine to run at a consistent speed regardless of your monitor's refresh rate. Whether you're on a 60Hz laptop or a 240Hz gaming monitor, the game now plays exactly the same!

**Impact:** Fair gameplay for everyone, no more hardware advantages.

---

### 2. **More Accurate Collision Detection** 🎯
**The Problem:** Collisions sometimes felt unfair - you'd get hit when it looked like you clearly dodged the obstacle, or vice versa.

**The Fix:** We've upgraded from simple circular hitboxes to precise rectangular collision boxes that match each obstacle's actual shape. Every enemy and obstacle now has a carefully tuned hitbox.

**Impact:** Fairer gameplay - if it looks like you dodged it, you did!

---

### 3. **Debug Mode for Transparency** 🔍
**New Feature:** Press the **'P' key** during gameplay to open the debug menu and see exactly where collision boxes are.

**Why This Matters:** We want to be transparent about how the game works. You can now see for yourself that collisions are fair and accurate.

**How to Use:**
1. Start playing the game
2. Press 'P' on your keyboard
3. Click "Show Collision Boxes"
4. See the actual hitboxes in real-time!

---

### 4. **Improved Music System** 🎵
**What Changed:**
- **Persistent Mute:** Your audio settings now save across sessions - if you mute the game, it stays muted when you return
- **Live Character Music:** Switching characters during gameplay now changes the music instantly
- **Better Performance:** Fixed memory leaks that could cause slowdowns during extended play sessions

**Impact:** Smoother audio experience and better overall performance.

---

### 5. **Leaderboard Now on Home Page** 🏆
**New Feature:** You can now check the leaderboard directly from the home page without having to start a game!

**Why This Matters:**
- See where you rank before playing
- Check out top players anytime
- Guest-friendly (no need to play first)

**How to Access:** Look for the shiny trophy icon on the home page and click it!

---

### 6. **Better Game State Management** 🎮
**What Changed:**
- Fixed bug where jump sounds played after game over
- Improved input handling for cleaner gameplay
- Better memory management prevents slowdowns

**Impact:** Cleaner, more responsive gameplay experience.
