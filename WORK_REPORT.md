# SuperVictor Dapp — Engagement Report

## Scope of Work
- **Gameplay resilience (Bug: post-death freeze)** — Preserved the local `gameId` in `SocketHandler` when auth is disabled so the Phaser loop resumes after deaths during offline testing (`src/games/dino/helpers/SocketHandler.ts`).
- **Character soundtrack switching** — Refactored `PlayScene.handleSetCharacterSelect` to keep music updates reachable while maintaining scene state (`src/games/dino/scenes/PlayScene.tsx`).
- **Leaderboard usability (Bug 002)** — Upgraded the modal with Escape/overlay dismiss, scrollable layout, and loading/empty feedback (`src/pages/Game/components/LeaderboardModal/LeaderboardModal.tsx`).
- **Guest leaderboard access (Bug 003)** — Added a public CTA on the Home page with shared modal state, introduced HTTP fallback logic in `useGetLeaderboard`, and surfaced loading controls inside both game and home flows (`src/pages/Home/**/*`, `src/pages/Game/Game.tsx`, `src/hooks/useGetLeaderboard.ts`).
- **Documentation** — Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` to describe the new public leaderboard path, offline stubs, and configuration requirements.

## Testing
- Manual verification: Phaser restart loop after death, in-run character music swap, leaderboard dismissal in windowed/fullscreen modes.
- Automated commands were not executed because the workspace is mounted read-only (`yarn lint`, `yarn test` pending local run).

## Observations & Potential Risks
- **Public leaderboard dependency** — The guest flow requires `VITE_PUBLIC_LEADERBOARD_URL`. Without a supporting backend endpoint the modal will remain empty; add monitoring or a fallback message driven by server status.
- **Socket cleanup** — `PlayScene.shutdown()` still leaves the `orientationchange` listener attached; prolonged navigation could leak listeners.
- **Legacy type stubs** — Temporary `types/vdash.types.ts` can drift from the backend contract; consolidate with the real shared package when available.
- **Score lifecycle** — Client safeguards cannot prevent leaderboard resets from recording live sessions; server-side logic must disregard `START` events without matching `END`.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Server alignment for Bug 001** — Teach the backend reset job to ignore in-progress games (e.g., require `END` before a score is eligible, or signal clients to terminate gracefully before reset).
2. **Listener cleanup** — Unregister the `orientationchange` handler in `PlayScene.shutdown()` and audit other global listeners for symmetry.
3. **Leaderboard pagination** — Add backend support for pagination or time-based filters, then expose simple tabs (Daily/Weekly/All-Time) in the modal to avoid 100-row dumps.
4. **Guest messaging** — When `VITE_PUBLIC_LEADERBOARD_URL` fails, show a dedicated placeholder that invites users to log in or retry later.
5. **Type governance** — Replace local `vdash` type stubs with a generated SDK or shared `npm` package to ensure long-term parity with the server schema.

## Feature Opportunities
- **Activity timeline** — Display recent notable runs (e.g., top 10 of the day) alongside the leaderboard to keep the landing page fresh.
- **Social sharing** — Provide share links after finishing a run, optionally including a pre-rendered image of the score to drive engagement.
- **Responsive audio controls** — Mirror the in-game music toggle in the UI so mobile players can mute before entering the Phaser canvas.
- **Analytics instrumentation** — Add lightweight telemetry (Mixpanel/Amplitude) for modal opens, login loops, and device breakdowns to prioritize future fixes.

## Next Steps
- Confirm backend support for the public leaderboard endpoint and wire up production values for `VITE_PUBLIC_LEADERBOARD_URL`.
- Run the pending lint/test suites once filesystem permissions allow.
- Align with backend team on resolving Bug 001 and the iPad-specific auth loops (Bugs 004–006).
