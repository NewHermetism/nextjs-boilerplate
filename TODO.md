# TODO

## Done
- [x] Add offline dev mode (`VITE_DISABLE_AUTH=true`) to bypass auth and sockets; stub profile and leaderboard for local gameplay.
- [x] Make gameplay frame-rate independent (normalize movement by delta time; consistent speed on 60Hz/144Hz).

## Next
- [ ] Add a LeaderBoard (enhanced):
  - Integrate a full in-app leaderboard view (beyond the modal) with pagination, filters, and avatar breakdown.
  - Ensure works both with live sockets and with the offline stub.
