# SuperVictor Dapp Session Summary

## Overview
- Refreshed gameplay stability for offline testing flows.
- Improved leaderboard UX and added a guest-facing entry point from the Home page.
- Updated architectural docs and prepared a work report capturing risks and next steps.

## Resolved / Addressed Bugs
| ID | Title | Resolution |
|----|-------|------------|
| — (Phaser freeze) | Game stopped after player death with auth disabled | Preserved local `gameId` in `SocketHandler` so the update loop continues between deaths. |
| — (Frame-rate dependency) | Game speed tied to display refresh rate | Game loop corrected earlier to decouple physics from monitor Hz, ensuring consistent speed across devices. |
| 002 | Leaderboard close control not visible | Modal now supports Escape, overlay click, and scrollable content, ensuring dismissal on all screens. |
| 003 | Leaderboard required login | Added a Home page CTA and HTTP fallback so guests can open the leaderboard without authentication. |

## Enhancements
- Character selection now updates soundtrack immediately during active runs.
- Leaderboard modal shows loading and empty states; reuse across Game and Home pages.
- Home screen sports a dedicated `Leaderboard` card with right-sized typography.

## Documentation
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` reflects the public leaderboard path, new config (`VITE_PUBLIC_LEADERBOARD_URL`), and offline `gameId` stub behavior.
- `WORK_REPORT.md` details the engagement scope, testing status, risks, improvements, and feature ideas.

## Testing Status
- Manual: Restart loop, in-run music swap, modal dismissal (fullscreen/windowed).
- Automated (`yarn lint`, `yarn test`): Not executed due to read-only workspace—run locally before deploying.

## Follow-Up Recommendations
1. Coordinate with backend to exclude active sessions during leaderboard resets (Bug 001).
2. Provide reliable public leaderboard data/service; monitor `VITE_PUBLIC_LEADERBOARD_URL` failures.
3. Clean up remaining global listeners (`orientationchange`), replace temporary `vdash` type stubs, and consider pagination/filters for future leaderboard iterations.
